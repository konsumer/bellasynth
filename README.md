# bellasynth

This is a synth made with puredata, on a pi4. It's meant to run headless, and boot immediately into a puredata patch. It's based on [patchbox os](https://community.blokas.io/t/beta-patchbox-os-image-2022-05-17/3774)

- Use [this 8-encoder thing](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/8Encoder) in puredata (see [pipd](https://github.com/konsumer/pipd/tree/main/extensions))
- Use an HDMI LCD for screen (with custom UI interface)
