# bellasynth

This is a synth made with puredata, on a pi4. It's meant to run headless, and boot immediately into a puredata patch. It's based on [patchbox os](https://community.blokas.io/t/beta-patchbox-os-image-2022-05-17/3774)

- Use [8encoder](https://github.com/konsumer/8encoder) for puredata, pigpio & python drivers for [this 8-encoder thing](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/8Encoder)
- Use [PiSound](https://blokas.io/pisound/) for sound
- Use an HDMI LCD for scxreen (with custom UI interface)
