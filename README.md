# bellasynth

This is a synth made with puredata, on a pi4. It's meant to run headless, and boot immediately into a puredata patch.

- Use [8encoder](https://github.com/konsumer/8encoder) for wiring & python drivers for [this 8-encoder thing](https://docs.m5stack.com/en/unit/8Encoder)
- Use [puredata-pi](https://github.com/konsumer/puredata-pi) for native puredata extensions
